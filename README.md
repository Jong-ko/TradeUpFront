# Barter House

## What We Set Out To Do

Barter House is a platform we created where users can trade their items. When users visit the website, they are prompted to create an account and add a picture of their item along with some information.
Then they will be able to browse other user's items by catagory and offer trades with items they want. When a user goes to the Offers page, they can see all of the trade offers they have sent aswell as any offers they may have received. Once an offer has been accepted, the trade will go into pending and both parties will be prompted to approve the trade once they have received the item. Once both parties have approved the trade, the trade will be completed and the items will be switched on the users accounts.
